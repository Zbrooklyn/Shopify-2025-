## Introduction

In today's competitive e-commerce environment—especially in the health and wellness sector—optimizing your Google Shopping feed is essential. Well-crafted product titles and descriptions improve your product's visibility in search results, build trust with shoppers, and ultimately lead to higher conversion rates. This project offers detailed guidelines and system prompts to help you create clear, compliant, and keyword-rich content that adheres to Google’s requirements and health advertising standards.

## Background & Importance

Optimized product data is critical for several reasons:

- **Search Visibility:** Including relevant keywords ensures that your products appear in the right search queries.
- **Customer Engagement:** Clear, concise, and factual descriptions help customers quickly understand product benefits.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Adhering to legal and regulatory standards (e.g., FDA, MHRA, TGA) minimizes the risk of disapprovals and penalties.
- **Conversion Optimization:** Structured, readable content with prioritized information improves click-through rates and drives sales.

## Compliance Guidelines for Health Products

- **Legal & Regulatory Compliance:**
  - Ensure all claims meet local regulatory standards (FDA, MHRA, TGA, etc.).
  - Avoid exaggerated or unverified claims like “miracle” or “guaranteed cure.”

- **Privacy & Sensitive Data:**
  - Do not include sensitive personal health data.
  - Use only non-personalized targeting unless fully compliant with privacy laws (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).

- **Factual & Non-Misleading:**
  - Use clear and accurate language without overpromising.
  - Exclude promotional text (pricing, sale dates) from product titles and descriptions.

- **Structured Content:**
  - Organize details using bullet points, proper punctuation, and clear separators (dashes, pipes, commas).

- **Keyword Optimization:**
  - Naturally incorporate high-impact keywords (e.g., “TMJ pain relief”, “hot and cold therapy”) without overstuffing.

## System Prompt for Optimizing Product Titles

Please optimize the following product title for Google Shopping. Your optimized title should adhere to the following guidelines:

**Keyword-Rich & Clear:**
- Include relevant keywords that potential shoppers would use. Focus on the product type and its primary features.

**Length & Visibility:**
- Use up to 150 characters, ensuring that the most important information (key keywords, product type, main benefits) appears within the first 70 characters, as this portion is most visible on many devices.

**Structured & Readable:**
- Organize the title logically with clear separators (such as dashes “–”, pipes “|”, or commas) to delineate attributes like product type, key features, differentiators (e.g., therapy type, support, relief), and variant details (e.g., color, size, material).

**Factual & Compliant for Health Products:**
- Use clear, accurate, and non-misleading language without exaggeration or unverified claims (avoid terms like “miracle” or “guaranteed cure”).
- Avoid including promotional text (e.g., pricing, sale dates) and omit brand names if not required.
- Ensure any health-related claims align with approved guidelines and indicate that the product provides symptom support or non-prescription relief.

**Privacy & Local Regulatory Compliance:**
- Do not incorporate sensitive personal health data.
- Ensure the title complies with local regulatory requirements (such as FDA, MHRA, TGA) by accurately describing the product without implying unauthorized medical treatments.

**Additional Best Practices:**
- Avoid extra white spaces and excessive punctuation.
- Use digits (e.g., "2" instead of "two") and proper capitalization (capitalize the first letter of each important word; avoid all caps that may appear spammy).
- For products with variants, include relevant attributes to distinguish each variant.

**Output Requirements:**  
Return the optimized product title in JSON format using the structure below:

```json
{
  "optimized_title": "Your optimized title here",
  "explanation": "A brief explanation summarizing key changes made, including improvements in clarity, compliance, and keyword usage."
}
```

## System Prompt for Optimizing Product Descriptions

Please optimize the following product description for Google Shopping. Your optimized description must meet these guidelines:

**Clarity & Readability:**
- Use clear, concise, and factual language that explains the product’s features and benefits.
- Organize content using bullet points or short paragraphs where appropriate to enhance readability.

**Compliance & Accuracy:**
- Avoid exaggerated or unverified claims (e.g., “miracle” or “guaranteed cure”).
- Ensure that all statements are accurate and compliant with health advertising standards.

**Structure & Detail:**
- Clearly highlight key features and benefits (e.g., adjustable strap, reusable gel packs, built-in pockets).
- Include specific details that help shoppers understand the product and its usage scenarios.

**Length & Formatting:**
- Aim for a detailed yet concise description (ideally up to 500 characters).
- Use formatting elements (like bullet points and line breaks) to structure the information.
  *Note: The final output should be a plain text string within JSON, and while bullet points and newline characters are preserved in the string, their visual formatting depends on the display tool.*

**Keyword Optimization:**
- Naturally incorporate relevant keywords (e.g., 'hands-free facial compress', 'hot and cold therapy', 'TMJ pain relief', 'adjustable strap') to boost search visibility without resorting to keyword stuffing.

**Output Requirements:**  
Return the optimized product description in JSON format using the structure below:

```json
{
  "optimized_description": "Your optimized product description here",
  "explanation": {
    "Clarity & Readability": "Explain how the language was simplified and structured for better readability.",
    "Compliance & Accuracy": "Detail how the description avoids exaggerated claims and complies with health advertising guidelines.",
    "Structure & Detail": "Describe the inclusion and organization of key product features and benefits.",
    "Keyword Optimization": "Explain the placement and selection of keywords to enhance search visibility."
  }
